## Current Projects


## Past Projects (2016 - 2019)

Prior to joining TIB, I worked for ~3 years as a research assistant with [Dr. Saket Anand](https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~anands/) (IIITD) on Visual Wildlife Monitoring and collaborated with [Wildlife Institute of India (WII)](https://wii.gov.in/), Dehradun. During this time, I worked on projects spanning individual recognition (Biometrics) and object detection/classification for patterned wildlife species, rhesus macaques and several Indian terrestrial wildlife species. In addition, I explored semi-supervised learning, explainability/uncertainty/compression (Bayesian Deep Learning) and confidence calibration with an aim to analyze and improve deep learning models to be used with real data. I also collaborated with [Ankita Shukla](https://ankita-shukla.github.io/) (PhD student, IIITD) and [Dr. Ryan Farrell](https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~farrell/) (BYU, Utah) during my time as a research assistant.

## Past Projects (2014 - 2016)

I received my master's from [IIIT, Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/), where my [thesis](https://repository.iiitd.edu.in/jspui/handle/123456789/429) was about exploring mean shift clustering using metric learning, under the guidance of Dr. Saket Anand. During master's, I also worked extensively on developing a traffic light/sign detection module for IIITD's autonomous car project [SWARATH](https://cai.iiitd.ac.in/research.php) and also mentored students to improve the module.
