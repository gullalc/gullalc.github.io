I am a fourth year PhD student at Leibniz University Hannover, Germany and work as a researcher in the [Fake Narratives](https://fakenarratives.github.io/) project. Prior to this, I was a [MSCA](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/node_en) fellow and worked on one of the projects in [CLEOPATRA](http://cleopatra-project.eu/) ITN. I am employed as a research assistant at [Visual Analytics Group](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/visual-analytics/), TIB and advised by [Dr. Ralph Ewerth](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/visual-analytics/staff/ralph-ewerth/). I closely collaborate with [Dr. Sherzod Hakimov](https://sherzod-hakimov.github.io/) (Now at University of Potsdam), [Dr. Eric MÃ¼ller-Budack](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=Ian_NPUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Christian Otto](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=hL-N3mUAAAAJ&hl=en). My current work and research revolves around interdesciplinary topics like ***deep/machine learning, multimodality with focus on Computer Vision and NLP, semiotics and digital humanities***.

My research on multimodality spans across challenging applications like claim, hate-speech, sentiment and out-of-context media detection. My thesis focuses on multimodal alignment, cross-modal relations and semiotics in the context of multimodal media content in the news domain.
