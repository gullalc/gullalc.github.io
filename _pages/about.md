I am a fourth year PhD student at Leibniz University Hannover, Germany and work as a researcher in the [Fake Narratives](https://fakenarratives.github.io/) project. Prior to this, I was a [MSCA](https://ec.europa.eu/research/mariecurieactions/node_en) fellow and worked on one of the projects in [CLEOPATRA](http://cleopatra-project.eu/) ITN. I am employed as a research assistant at [Visual Analytics Group](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/visual-analytics/), TIB and advised by [Dr. Ralph Ewerth](https://www.tib.eu/en/research-development/visual-analytics/staff/ralph-ewerth/). I closely collaborate with [Dr. Sherzod Hakimov](https://sherzod-hakimov.github.io/) (Now at University of Potsdam), [Dr. Eric MÃ¼ller-Budack](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=Ian_NPUAAAAJ&hl=en) and [Christian Otto](https://scholar.google.de/citations?user=hL-N3mUAAAAJ&hl=en). My current work and research revolves around interdesciplinary topics like ***deep/machine learning, multimodality with focus on Computer Vision and NLP, semiotics and digital humanities***.

My research on multimodality spans across challenging applications like claim, hate-speech, sentiment and out-of-context media detection. My thesis focuses on multimodal alignment, cross-modal relations and semiotics in the context of multimodal media content in the news domain.

<!-- Prior to joining TIB, I worked for ~3 years as a research assistant with [Dr. Saket Anand](https://faculty.iiitd.ac.in/~anands/) (IIITD) on Visual Wildlife Monitoring and collaborated with [Wildlife Institute of India (WII)](https://wii.gov.in/), Dehradun. During this time, I worked on projects spanning individual recognition (Biometrics) and object detection/classification for patterned wildlife species, rhesus macaques and several Indian terrestrial wildlife species. In addition, I explored semi-supervised learning, explainability/uncertainty/compression (Bayesian Deep Learning) and confidence calibration with an aim to analyze and improve deep learning models to be used with real data. I also collaborated with [Ankita Shukla](https://ankita-shukla.github.io/) (PhD student, IIITD) and [Dr. Ryan Farrell](https://faculty.cs.byu.edu/~farrell/) (BYU, Utah) during my time as a research assistant.

I received my master's from [IIIT, Delhi](https://iiitd.ac.in/), where my [thesis](https://repository.iiitd.edu.in/jspui/handle/123456789/429) was about exploring mean shift clustering using metric learning, under the guidance of Dr. Saket Anand. During master's, I also worked extensively on developing a traffic light/sign detection module for IIITD's autonomous car project [SWARATH](https://cai.iiitd.ac.in/research.php) and also mentored students to improve the module. -->
